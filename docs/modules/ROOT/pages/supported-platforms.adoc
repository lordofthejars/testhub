= Supported platforms and system requirements

Test Hub is just a Go library so it can be natively compiled to many different operative systems and hardware.

Currently support is provided to `Mac OS X` 64 bits, `Linux` 64 bits and `Windows` 64 bits.

NOTE: If you need support for any other platform feel free to open an issue to the project and we will add support for other architectures.
