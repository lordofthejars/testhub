= Run Test Hub server
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Assumptions:

* [x] You've xref:installation.adoc[installed Test Hub] using any of the methods explained there.
* [x] You have Test Hub CLI on `PATH` environment path variable.
* [x] You've xref:1.0@testhubclient::installation.adoc[installed Test Hub client] to interact with Test Hub server.
* [x] You've run a Maven test phase (`mvn clean test`) in a none multi-module project.

== Starting Test Hub

To start Test Hub you only need to run next command from your terminal:

`~ $ testhub start`

After that you can go to http://localhost:8000 to access to the main page of Test Hub.
If it is the first time you start Test Hub, then you will see an screen similar as:

.Initial Home Page of Test Hub
image::empty_initial_home_page.png[]

It is empty because we have not registered any project and build yet.

So now everything is up and running, it is time to register first project and build.

IMPORTANT: By default all data is stored at `~/.hub` directory. This location is configurable and we'll cover in <<Configuration of Test Hub, configuration>> section.

[#registering]
== Registering first project

Test Hub server opens a _REST API_ so anyone can interact with it without been tight to any client, but to simplify the adoption to Test Hub, there is also a xref:1.0@testhubclient::index.adoc[Test Hub client] to interact with.

So move to the root of the project you want to publish test results to Test Hub, and after running `mvn clean test`, run next command:

`~ $ testhubclient --project hello-world --build 1`

Notice that you can substitute the `project` name to the name of the project and the `build` represents the identifier of the build.
Notice that in a CI/CD environment some variables are set as envirnoment variables, so you only need to reasign them to the flag.
For example in _Travis CI_:

`~ $  testhubclient --project hello-world --build $TRAVIS_JOB_NUMBER`

Then just refresh home page http://localhost:8000 and you should see that now there is a new card box with the project.

== Navigating through the site

=== Project Details

If you click on project name, you'll see an image similar as:

.Project Details Home Page
image::project_details.png[]

In this page you can see the evolution of number of tests of the project, in this current case there is only one run.
Also you can see how the duration of tests has evolved as well as the duration of last execution.

Notice that then there is a section where you can see each of the builds that has been registered for this project.
In each card, build number, number of tests and if all tests suceeded or not is shown, so you can get a quick overview of the build.

=== Build Details

You can click on build number to get build details, and you'll see an image similar as:

.Build Details Home Page
image::build_details.png[]

In this page you can see the summary of the test execution and also a card with some icons which allows you to navigate to source code repository, branch used and commit id where build has been run.
This information is only available if it is provided when build is registered.
Read xref:1.0@testhubclient::publish_test_result_report.adoc[Test Hub client documentation] for concrete example on how to send project build information.

And finally a list of all test classes executed with results.
If you click on test class, the list is expanded with information regarding each of the test method executed in that class:

[#configuring]
== Configuration of Test Hub

The command to start Test Hub is `start`.

This operation supports next flags:

[#cli-start-flags]

=== Configuration file

Test Hub can also be configured by using a file instead of passing arguments.
The file must be named `testhub.yml` and by default placed on the directory where you are starting Test Hub.
You can change the folder where `testhub.yml` file is placed by using `--config` argument.

IMPORTANT: CLI arguments takes more precedence than the ones configured in file.
