= Test Hub

Test Hub is designed to act as central hub for storing test reports such as test result report, coverage report or video recording of test execution.

Test Hub provides a REST API to connect with but you can also use xref:1.0@testhubclient::index.adoc[Test Hub Client] which is a CLI tool to interact with it.
