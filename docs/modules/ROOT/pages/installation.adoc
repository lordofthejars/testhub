== Docker

Test Hub is also provided as Docker image.

For example:

`~ $  docker run -ti --rm -p 8000:8000 lordofthejars/testhub:<version>` 

Just start Test Hub server at port `8000`.
Notice that now all test reports are lost when container is stopped.
Volume `/home/testhub/.hub` is also exposed so you can mount it to a local directory to not loose data when container is stopped.
